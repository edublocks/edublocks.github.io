# Fortune Teller

## Overview

In this tutorial we are going to create a simple micro:bit powered Fortune Teller so that when you
shake the micro:bit, it will generate a random answer to a question that you have asked.

You will need 
- An internet connection
- A BBC micro:bit
- A USB cable

## Get Started
Duration: 1:00

Start by going to a web browser on your PC or Mac. Type in the following address in the search bar:

```
https://app.edublocks.org
```

Once you have pointed your browser to that link, you'll want to select the micro:bit mode in the mode selector.

Once you've selected the micro:bit mode, you should see it pop up:

## Import the libraries
Duration: 1:00

Now its time to build our code. We can drag our code blocks from the EduBlocks toolbar which is on the left hand side of the screen. The pink
blocks can be found in the basic menu. This will form the start of the code. Both blocks are necessary for this program to work.
